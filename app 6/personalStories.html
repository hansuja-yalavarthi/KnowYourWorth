          <h3>
            As I navigated my career as a marketing manager, I faced persistent challenges stemming from gender inequality in the workplace. Despite over a decade of experience and a proven track record of success, I often felt overlooked for promotions and pay raises. My performance reviews seemed biased, focusing on perceived shortcomings while ignoring my contributions to successful campaigns. This pattern left me feeling undervalued and frustrated, especially as my male counterparts received recognition and advancement for similar work. It became increasingly clear that my hard work was not being rewarded in the same way as theirs.
<br>
The impact of this bias extended beyond my professional growth; it significantly affected my salary. I found myself earning considerably less than my male colleagues, despite holding the same role and responsibilities. This pay gap weighed heavily on my confidence and career trajectory, making it difficult for me to advocate for myself. Determined to address these inequalities, I sought out mentorship and connected with other women facing similar obstacles. Together, we aimed to raise awareness about the pervasive issues of bias and pay disparity in our industry, hoping to pave the way for a more equitable workplace for ourselves and future generations.

          <h3>
            Jasmine faced significant bias when applying for promotions at her tech company. Despite
            her qualifications and consistent performance, she was often overlooked in favor of male
            colleagues who had less experience. During meetings, her ideas were frequently dismissed
            or attributed to male coworkers, leading her to feel invisible in a space where her
            contributions should have been valued. Jasmine decided to advocate for herself by
            documenting her achievements and seeking mentorship, ultimately leading to a successful
            promotion. Her story highlights the importance of visibility and self-advocacy in
            combating workplace bias.

          <h1><i>Patricia O'nally</i></h1>
          <h3>
            Patricia, a talented engineer, experienced bias when her project proposals were constantly
            met with skepticism from her male peers. They often questioned her technical abilities and
            challenged her ideas more than they did those of her male colleagues. This pattern of
            behavior not only affected her confidence but also led to delays in project approvals.
            After speaking with a mentor, Patricia began to document the feedback she received, which
            helped her build a case to present her proposals more assertively. Over time, she gained
            recognition for her expertise, proving that persistence and strategic communication can
            help overcome gender bias in technical fields.
